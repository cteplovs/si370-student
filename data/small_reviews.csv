244509,4,Love Happy Tot,I just love the happy tot baby food line. It stores so easily and I know I'm feeding my baby the food that is good for her. So far she really is enjoying the taste.
87295,4,Feelin Hot Hot Hot,"Curry has become one of my favorite foods over the past year.  We've always struggled to make good curry at home as the grocery store curry pastes don't have very much flavor.  I always found myself having to use an entire jar instead of the 1Tbsp that they tell you to use.<br /><br />A friend of ours recommended we try this brand.  It had AWESOME flavor but ended up being a tad too spicy for our taste.  I'm not sure we'll purchase it again.  If we do we now know to not use quite as much.<br /><br />We've really been enjoying the Mae Ploy brand of curry pastes which can be found here on Amazon as well.<br /><br />If you like your green curry at Thai spice levels though, you'll LOVE this!"
377094,5,Wow. Very Maple-y,"Just tried this for the first time, and I'm quite pleased. We're planning to get some to take over when we visit friends in the UK - ""live"" syrup would be too risky to travel with - baggage handlers, airports, customs????<br /><br />I did find out some info by contacting Coombs directly - this is made from Grade A Dark Amber syrup; I would have preferred that they'd made it from the more flavorful Grade B, but ""A Dark"" will do in a pinch, and second, the woman at Coombs said it would re-constitute into syrup pretty well by adding 2/3 c. maple sugar to 1/3 c. water. Haven't tried as yet; suspect that 1/3 c. water may be a bit too much so I'll start with 1/4 when I try it.<br /><br />If reconstituting works out, it'll be great for any type of travel where weight and possibility of spills preclude taking real syrup along."
44261,4,"Good dark, rich coffee for breakfast time","After trying lots of different blends in K-Cups over the past couple of years, I've settled on a mix of Tully's French Roast and Newman's Extra Bold as my go-to choices for morning wake up coffees.  Both have a strong, deep flavor that pairs well with weekend waffles and other ""sweet"" goodies.  It's a shame that the price has gone up so much, but it's not the fault of the coffee.  I'll keep drinking this one -- it's one of my simple pleasures and still much more affordable than picking up a cup at the local espresso stand."
398439,5,Fantastic coffee!,"Exceptional coffee all around - rich, full, with subtle hints of dark chocolate. My coffee-snob neighbor just ordered 4 pounds herself after having just one cup!"
269511,5,Glenny's Brown Rice Marshmallow Treats,"These are a delicious vegan alternative to regular rice krispie treats. These have natural, organic ingredients, and are not made with gelatin/marshmallow. At 100 calories per bar, they make a great calorie controlled snack. The flavor was delicious, very similar to the regular rice krispie bar. The case I got was fresh. The bars were krispy and chewy like they should be. I would recommend these to anyone."
89042,1,disgusted,I have never cared for sweetened cereal as I was not raised on it. When I found Purely O's a few years ago I was happy to have found a cereal that did not contain sugar or corn products which I need to avoid because of a corn allergy.  I had intended to buy another box today. I took the time to read the label to make sure that nothing had changed. I could not believe that the ingredient list now lists CORN!  I am so angry!  Purely O's were my go-to breakfast when I needed a something quick or was in the mood for cereal.  There is nothing that this  company makes that I can now eat.  When will these people learn humans aren't pigs! Everything in a supermarket should not contain corn!  If I had wanted corny oat cereal I would have bought Cheerios.
225284,3,Mediocre Mango,"I've been looking for dried organic mango that is as delicious as that carried by Whole Foods, which only sporadically carries it in their bulk foods area.  This was not the mango I was searching for.  It was toooo dry and didn't exactly taste like mango -- it almost tasted more like dried persimmon.  It wasn't terrible -- that is, my family ate up the two pounds -- but not with the anticipated level of joy."
92943,3,Not impressed,"This meal-in-a-box was alright, but not amazing. You cook some chicken, add the spices, water, and the ""noodles"" (more like rice than noodles, but still good), and let it cook. After about 7 min, you add the dehydrated broccoli (you can't even taste it), cook it for a few more minutes, add the cheese, and serve.<br /><br />Now, I am somewhat of a health nut. For those like me, be aware that the product it contains trans fats. The spices packet has partially hydrogenated oil. That's the main reason I wouldn't buy it again. The other reason I wouldn't make it again is because it just doesn't seem healthy at all. The dehydrated broccoli is so minimal...you're best off adding your own fresh stuff. The cheese sauce is thick and just can't be good for you. If I were to make it again, I'd make this skillet dinner as a side. Instead of adding the chicken into the mix, I'd just serve chicken as the main part of the meal.<br /><br />So overall, the Velveeta skillet meal was ok, but not something I'd make again. If I want a quick dinner, I make Annie's Homegrown Skillet Meals. Annie's products leave out the trans fats and the terribly artificial ingredients. I would rather make my own food in general, but at least eating Annie's doesn't make me feel as unhealthy!"
22875,4,Great seasoning!,This product works well with most kinds of meat.  Gives a little extra zip to the flavor of the meat.
185225,2,Havahart Critter Ridder 3143 Animal Repellent Concentrate 8-Ounces,"Sprayed Animal Repellant with a slightly heavier concentration than instructions indicated. Although noxious to human scent, doesn't seem to work on whatever is attacking my tomatoes."
135070,4,Lipton's Peach Flavored Diet Ice Tea Mix,"Good taste, hard to find in stores/supermakets...Why?<br /> A good way to cut down on  diet carbonated beverages.<br />A little pricey unless you purchase in bulk on Amazon.<br />Why aren't other brands making similar products?"
380262,1,I did not get this item,"I did not receive this item. I don't know what happened, I did not get any explanation from the seller."
140406,5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SWEET TASTY AND THE KIDS LOVE THEM....GREAT FOR PARTIES OR ANY HOT SUMMER DAY....ALL OF THE FLAVORS TASTE GREAT..."
205062,5,Fantastic orange flower water,This is a great product for a pretty good price too.  It was shipped quickly and I have used it a number of times.  It is called for in some mixed drinks.  I've also used it in a cream sauce to give just a hint of orange flavor.  Wonderful!
329681,5,Dogs love these,It is hard to find Greenies at a good price. This was the best price that i have found recently. My dog loves Greenies.
226183,4,Tasty selection,"Chocolate chocolate chocolate!  And at the end of munching, a nice pail for whatever: pencils, paintbrushes, dried lotus blossoms, your choosing. The presentation is very nice stuffed with chocolates and I wouldn't hesitate to send another as a gift to a friend or business associate."
244123,5,Great Product!,"I bought this product for my boyfriend who absolutely loves it! I've tried it before, it has a GREAT flavor, just like drinking chocolate milk! The shipping was quick too!"
90807,1,Moist and Juicy... NOT...,I like a variety of jerky but this Peppered style from Oh Boy! all I can say is Oh NO!!!!!! Thin sliced is OK but not when it is as dry as cardboard. I did not like this product at all. I don't usually do reviews but I felt I had to give my opinion on this one. I will NOT be buying this one again... Sorry Oh Boy! Oberto...
63693,5,Lives Up to illy's Standard,"I'm a big ice coffee drinker but I usually prefer to either make it myself or purchase it from a coffee shop where I know it's at least been made on the premise. Freshness is generally something that you can recognize when it comes to coffee. That's why I avoid drinks like those Starbucks Double Shot cans. They taste generic and fake.<br /><br />I usually use a Tassimo pod based brewer to get my caffeine fix but I've made coffee using illy beans before. It really is great coffee. As far as coffee drinks go, it's pretty hard to beat the illy issimo coffee drink. It actually tastes like coffee and isn't drowned out by preservatives or whatever other junk they put into canned coffee.<br /><br />I tend to take my coffee with as little milk as possible. I found that the milk level in this drink was fine, something that I usually take umbrage with when it comes to canned coffee. I suppose you could add more milk if you really wanted to, but I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />The price for a pack of twelve of these is a bit steep for coffee, but I guess it makes sense considering what the other canned coffees cost. If canned coffee is your thing, certainly go for the illy coffee drink. It really does taste quite good."
261237,5,The Best Curry Mix,"This is the only curry mix I use. It's terrific and has the perfect combination of spices. Be careful, it's hot!"
392521,5,MY FAVORITE JELLY BELLY FLAVOR,HAPPY TO FIND A SOURCE FOR THESE SINCE STORES HAVEN'T BEEN RESTOCKING THIS FLAVOR WHEN SOLD OUT.
28036,1,NOT EARS -- ONLY SMALL STRIPS,"These USED to be whole pig ears two years ago.... but now?<br />They are just pig ear pieces!!  What a total RIP-OFF!!<br />What is next?  Pig ear ""chips""??<br />This is an embarrassment to the marketing industry... cheating<br />the customer.  And, it doesn't matter whether they were bought<br />on Amazon -- or at Sam's.... the result is the same.<br />If the package says ""25 PIG EARS""... then to package 'pieces'<br />is a total FRAUD.  I wonder if a lawsuit against the company would help??"
517335,4,Too strong to drink straight!,"I mix this half and half with Crystal Light Iced Tea with Lemon, and it turns out just right for my Arnold Palmer."
385380,5,The best coffee,I make it strong with a little coconut milk creamer in it. The flavor is amazing for instant. No more coffee pot. No more starbucks. Great autoship price from Amazon.
222067,3,Close but not the same,"These don't taste the same as the small bags from the vending machines.<br />Very close, but not exactly the same. Crispier (drier) with less veggie taste.<br />The bag's I received are not as shown: they say 'Toasted Chips' & 'Fresh new look'! 'Garden Valley Veggie'.<br />This bag and the Ritz toasted chips are identical<br />Still a great deal. unable to find these in any supermarket or wholesale club. Only at Amazon!!<br /><br />Update: Found them at BJ's club today for less money."
123056,5,"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, QUALITY DOG FOOD!!!","I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!"
565266,5,WORTH THE WAIT,Healthy and Delious . . . what more could you want?<br />1/2 hour is not to long a cooking time in exchange for best oats I've ever had. I've had no problem with them sticking to the pan. I stir them maybe three times during the cook time. I also cooked a double batch and refrigerated them overnight. They were just as great tasting as when first cooked. I then tried freezing some and a few days later had them for breakfast and they were still great tasting. I don't know if refrigerating or freezing them makes them less healthly but it was quicker if you don't have the time.
374285,5,great,received the movie in great condition.  very happy with my purchase.  My nephew will love it!<br />thanks for the great service!
131103,5,Simply Caramel,My absolutely favorite candy bar!  I am disabled and it's hard to get out. So glad I found this on Amazon!  So convenient. Fast shipping!  Thank you!
239267,5,Nice drink!,"I first bought a Java teeccino at my local health co-op.  I liked it a lot, but was curious about the other flavors.  So I got the sampler pack from teeccino online so I could try all the flavors.<br /><br />Vanilla nut is a nice flavor.  Truthfully some of the flavors do not seem to be differentiated from each other, but this one definitely has it's own flavor profile.  I keep coming up with ""vanilla coconut"" when I taste it.  If you are looking for something to taste as close as possible to Coffee - this isn't the flavor.  I would suggest Maya Caffe for the closest flavor to coffee.  But this vanilla nut is very enjoyable in its own right.<br /><br />This beverage is a nice alternative to coffee.  No it does not taste like coffee exactly.  It has it's own taste and feel.  But I'm finding that I REALLY enjoy drinking it for the flavor it does have.  The only negative aspect is that it does contain more calories than coffee or tea.  However, the way I feel after I drink it (in comparison to coffee) far outweighs the small calorie content.<br /><br />I use 1 TB in my french press and about 12oz of water boiled in my tea kettle.  Such a quick, easy, inexpensive and enjoyable method of brewing.<br /><br />I would reccommend the sampler pack (free shipping) from the teeccino website and then order your favorite flavors through subscribe and save on amazon.  That will give you the best price."
199912,5,Delicious!,"I bought this juice to make a drink my wife and I had while in Bora Bora, French Polynesia. It was called ""Tahiti Drink"" and the ingredients called for passion fruit amongst other things. The juice was priced very reasonably and arrived quickly and well packaged. The juice itself was delicious. One reviewer stated it was too sweet, I dont believe this to be true at all. It does have some sweetness to it but by no means is it too sweet. It is very refreshing, has a good balance of acidity and sweetness and did the job in recreating the Tahiti drink."
312383,5,Unexpected,"Not a typical tasting drink. If you are familiar with kombucha, this product tastes great. If you have never had kombucha, you will be surprised by the slight vinegar taste, and by the fact that this tea is not sweet at all. Overall a great tasting kombucha tea"
431670,1,Diarrhea,"Stopped giving this product to my 9 yr old lab mix because she developed really bad diarrhea. Now I have her on probiotics and scheduled a vet appointment. Other than her having a weight issue, she has never been sick. Sorry I switched to this food."
175476,5,"Not for every, dog but nothing is.","For those of you with champion chewers, I would reccomend this whole heartedly.  I have one destructive chewer that loves it and takes him an hour or so to get the treat out, but if I put little treats inside it takes him alot longer (he even gives up on it).  I have another that has the treat out in 5 minutes and has the little treats out in about an hour (he then waits for the other dog to give up, then finishes that off too).  The blue silicone part is the toy they have had the longest and seems to still be lasting.  I have had it over 6 months.  I have the red fire hydrant one also and it is almost torn up and I have had it less time than this.  I think the configuration of the other allows my dog a better angle to chew (and thus destroy)the toy.<br /><br />I know some people who have destructive dogs complain that it does not last but I would venture to say thier dog is so destructive that nothing works.  I would be interested to know if it outlasted most other toys given to them.  I am not saying it will work for sure for your dog, but I do say it is worth a try, as I considered my dogs hopeless (they tore up everyting in 5 minutes or less) before I found this.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that if you moisten the edges the treat pops in easier (great to know because I was using a spoon to wedge it in).  Just make sure you let it dry before giving it to them so it is more difficult for your dog to get out and (love this tip) put the treat in upside down so the dome is facing inwards and the treat will last longer because it is more difficult for your doggie to get at."
66406,5,My favorite coffee!,"I really like this coffee and have been buying it for several years now.  However, where I was buying it - raised the price considerably.  Buying it via Amazon is the best buy."
165740,5,"First Vanilla Beans ordered, but seem great so far","This is the first time I have purchased vanilla beans, so I do not have anything to compare them to.  I purchased the vanilla beans with the intention of making homemade vanilla for ourselves and family.  This was the best value that I could find anywhere.  The vanilla has turned out well.  My wife just used some for baking the other day.  Compared to purchasing vanilla at the store (about $2 per ounce), the homemade vanilla is significantly cheaper (about $.50/ounce).  Again, I do not have other vanilla beans to compare these to, but they have produced a very good vanilla extract.<br /><br />Update March 2012: People all loved the vanilla that was made with these vanilla beans. One of our aunts kept getting compliments on her frosting, and the only thing she changed was using the homemade vanilla which was made using these beans. When we are ready to order more, we know where to get them from."
199654,4,"Great flavor, wish there was just a touch more pumpkin",I've finished almost the entire box.  I love this stuff.  I found a pumpkin creamer that goes great with this.  I only wish there was just a little bit more pumpkin flavor.  Excellent for the holidays.  But I still have a few cups lefts to enjoy after all the holiday commotion.
30626,5,SF Ciocolatta Calda,"Great Product!!!  If you have a Hot Chocolate Maker this is the product to have!!!  100% Chocolate, not too sweet, not too bitter.  Takes me back to my 3 years living in Italy!!!"
475335,3,Beef Straganoff,"January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars."
219923,1,Gross!,"Bought this product based on the good reviews, but was utterly grossed out once I tasted it. It is beyond unpleasant and the chocolate flavor is essentially non existent. I am extremely disappointed."
36000,4,Love this Tea!,"I am a real fan of Rishi teas and my favorite is the Mystic Mint tea.  I used to buy their ""Sweet Mint"", but I believe this one replaced it and tastes just as good.  I drink this tea hot or cold and it never disappoints!  4 stars instead of 5 because they went to double packaging it in a pouch in the can & you get less (1.76oz for Mystic Mint compared to 2.9oz for Sweet Mint).  I would rather get more product and less packaging for the same price."
58907,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!","I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their ""trial size"" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case."
277223,5,Weight Watcher Friendly Chips,These chips are very good and are only 2 points a serving per Weight Watcher points calculator.  I like the Barbeque Popchips best and having them in a single serve bag prevents me from eating more than a 0.8 ounce serving at one time .  This is my second order of chips and I will be ordering chips again.
63177,4,"""Cheez-IT, Pleez-e!""","The product description calls Kellogg's Sunshine Cheez-IT Mozzarella Cheese, a satisfying snack and claims that ...""regular snacking helps prevent overeating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day.""<br /><br />Forget regular snacking.  With Cheez-IT Mozzarella it's munching mania.  The snack is like an overly salty bag of potato chips, and everybody knows about the (false) prospects of having ""only"" one.  ""One more"" is the mantra of Cheez-IT Mozzarella.  So incredibly addictive, it is a definite staple for the average American's couch potato stash.<br /><br />Taste wise, although billed as ""100 percent real Mozzarella cheese,"" they have a chemical sting (you know, the one that Americans complain about, but secretly love).  However, the cheesy flavor is distinct, the texture of the cracker ... Cheez-IT ... all the way.  Keep them handy along with the other growing varieties of Cheez-IT crackers for the ultimate binge-snacking escape.<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE"
399583,4,Saves Me!,"This is the only dog food my little peak-a-poo will eat. I am so glad that Amazon has it on an Auto Delivery, there have been so many times that I have had to go from store to store looking for this flavor because it sells out so quickly. Now I don't have to worry ~ once a month a couple of cartons come and we're set!"
176477,4,Baby kikes them,"My daugher loves them so I usually give it to her when we go for a walk. However, like other reviewers noticed they are made in China which really worries me. I don't think I will buy them again. Need to look for another snack for my baby."
223203,5,AMAZING!,"This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean."
380062,5,I'm Very Impressed!,"I don't know what type beans are used in this vanilla. Frankly, I don't care.  This vanilla is KSA certified.  I have tried many brands of vanilla. Morton and Bassett is the most flavorful I have ever tried. The price is reasonable for such clean flavor. Pure vanilla is expensive but there are other brands that are pricier and doesn't taste as superb as M&B. I am convinced this is the best pure vanilla you can find in the US.  I do wish I knew what bean is used but maybe that's a trade secret.  It's Kosher certified and that's good enough for me. I have searched for the perfect taste in a vanilla for many years.  Thank you Morton and Bassett, my search is over!  Now I can enjoy a vanilla taste that is pure and smooth. I am very happy to have found this vanilla extract."
100298,4,Best so far,"I've had my Kuerig for about 6 months now.  The hardest thing to do is find good, bold, strong coffee that can be used to make a 10oz mug of coffee.  Too many (most) K-Cups produce a watery-horrible 10oz mug but this cup stands up.  A mug of this coffee is still rich and bold.  I still lhave a hard time with how much K-Cups cost but when on sale this is a worthwhile coffee."
259024,5,Smooooth,Great rich light roast cup of coffee and second only to my favorite mocca java (it is not chocolate flavored rather a region where the beans are grown)!
556877,4,"Great size, but not my dog's favorite","I bought these treats for the size. We go through a lot of treats on walks with our dog, who has some leash issues. I get frustrated with crumbs in my pockets and breaking up treats during walks. He is a picky fellow when it comes to treats. These are, in fact, a great size, but they dry out quickly as others have commented. I can live with that, but I think they may also lose flavor. My dog has become less and less interested in them, and it's to the point now where he seems to eat them as a favor to me. For the price, I can find more appealing treats elsewhere and live with permanent crumbs in my pocket."
27745,5,Very good chocolates,"Every chocolate manufacturer will have a chocolate that can go with every season and satisfy the taste buds of all generations. Well Lindt has this chocolate which tastes absolutely awesome and goes with any occassion. You can either get the milk chocolate or go for the assorted one which has dark and other cocoa variations of chocolates. There is a myth that Lindt has liquor in all of its chocolates which is not so - Most Lindt in USA will only have cocoa liquor. Dark chocolates with whisky and other liquor variants are normally available from European markets - I got it few days back - available in Amazon. An amazing chocolate that melts so much in your much and makes you go crazy over its taste. In my opinion, truffles are the best chocolates Lindt has ever made over these years. Affordable price has mentioned at Amazon - you don't get that many deals for these stufss as these are preferred round the year. You may also smaller gift boxes that has around 20 truffles - you can also mix and match based on your prefernce"
521501,5,"Excellent Taste, Innovative Tea-Bag!","I was quite surprised when I opened this box of teabags to find  a new innovative ""mesh"" bag instead of the all familiar paper tea-bags.I would guess the mesh would help the ""tea"" blend with the hot water. Well, whatever it's reason, this is one delicious cup of tea. The Blackberry and Vanilla flavors make an delicious combination and it is very satisfying.<br />I did not get a pick-up from this tea as you do with coffee, black tea or other caffeinated beverages, neither did it make me feel relaxed as does Camomile. Instead I just found it to be a refreshing tasteful tea that woke up my taste buds. The aroma it gives off is also quite pleasant!<br /><br />All-in-all, a delicious hot beverage, I thoroughly enjoyed them and so did my wife. Although we tried them for the Vine program, it is a product we will likely keep buying because of its interesting taste!"
53949,3,no extra charge for the crumbs?,"I love Keebler cookies and these chocolate-mint covered grahams are a long time favorite so I thought getting 6 packages at once would be a no-brainer. Unfortunately, the box must have gotten some hard knocks in transit because each and every package arrived with about a quarter of the cookies magically transformed to cookie-dust!!!<br /><br />As much as I love the brand and this flavor, I doubt I'll re-order them. From here on I'll probably just rely on getting one package at a time from the market..."
3638,5,Wonderful Product,Shipping was prompt and the product was what I fully expected.  It helped me be successful with Mama Agata's Lemon Cake where U.S. flours failed.
531178,1,Overpriced for what you get!,"The packaging on this salmon is better than the salmon itself and that's exactly what you pay for. This salmon isn't worth the money. The smell is horrible, it leaks everywhere and the salmon itself doesn't taste that great. What you're really getting is overpriced tuna fish!"
519979,5,At first I wasn't sure... then I found the trick!,"Chocolate Tortilla Chips:<br /><br />I bought these and I couldn't decide if I liked them or not.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to have with them.  However, I found two really great things!<br /><br />These chips with red wine!  Amazing!<br /><br />And if you have no shame... vanilla frosting.  salty + sweet.<br /><br />I don't think chips + red wine + vanilla frosting would work, but those two items (seperately) with these chocolate chips are wonderful!<br /><br />I didn't think I was going to order these again, now I've changed my mind."
3897,5,Awesome chai,"The 500 Mile Chai is just wonderful - the right balance of mellowness and spiciness.  I've tried some chai's that are a bit too spicy, but this one is very well balanced.  Great with almond milk and bonus points for it being organic (in as much as one can trust the ""organic"" label...).<br /><br />Compare to Peet's chai, I like the 500 mile better, as IMO Peet's is a little too much on the spicy side (although I do still like Peet's and some may prefer that flavor profile)."
149143,5,Fenugreek Aids in Breast Milk Production,"Daughter is breastfeeding but felt she wasn't producing enough milk. We decided to incorporate Fenugreek into her diet via various ways. Since she is a sprout lover, I agreed to grow these organic sprouts for her. I used about a tablespoon or so initially and was elated how well the seeds sprouted. There were very few seeds that didn't take. I did prewash and soak overnight in a hot rinse bath because the seeds are harder than some. What an incredible aroma from these sprouts. After 5 days in the mini Sprout Master, they crisped up in the fridge and are now a healthy addiction to daughter's diet. Fenugreek is known to help increase milk production and these seeds can also be ground and added to many Indian or African dishes for an unusual almost maple syrup taste. Very worth the extra time to sprout our own seeds without a fear of salmonella as many sprouts have been contaminated in the grocery stores. Always buy organic sprouting seeds."
513120,5,A Good Thing.,"Great coffee.<br /><br />Convenient packaging.<br /><br />And,<br /><br />as  the others have said,<br /><br />NO plastic cups to dispose of."
254558,4,authentic,"i have not purchased this product.  i am, due to the pics shown illustrating that these are genuine san marzano tomatoes.  not all on this site do that.  stated they were,  but were not.  i feel that if a company will go thru the trouble of showing its potential customers that it is genuine, i will purchase them.  yes, the comments did help.<br /><br />thanks for the pics, more should follow your example  of course, i will reveiew again, after i use them"
27544,5,"Healthy, easy to make, and apparently very tasty!","All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!"
230012,5,My favorite green tea,"Kirkland has an excellent, balanced flavor that is hard to find in other green teas. Highly recommended."
492827,5,Very good option for this teaPrompt shipping and well packed but,Very good product  a little bit on the brown side compare to the picture .. And like the other reviewer has some stems but all in all good quality and generous portion......  The tea is very good. For female health.  I use a French pressor comes out really nice
102321,5,Multi Bran Chex,I've bought this cereal from Amazon because I could no longer find it at local stores.<br />I've been eating it for over 7 years and it is one of the best cereals I've ever had.<br />I'm so glad it can be found on Amazon.  Its got a wonderful taste and great nutritional value as well.
479534,1,"Very Disappointed, Not Durable at All","I bought this toy because it touted being the most durable soft dog toy available. My dog loves to chew and really enjoys a soft squeaky toy. I was impressed by the ""7 rows of stitching"" and ""4 layers of material"" and thought it would be worth a try. My 60 lb. border collie mix was through all of it in less than 5 minutes and pulling the stuffing out. The toy I got at the dollar store lasted longer. If you are looking for a durable toy, I suggest looking elsewhere."
422761,5,Those Red Hot Blues are one bad mutha...,"You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!)."
389081,3,Delicious but not very satisfying,"Delicious but not very filling or satisfying no doubt due to the fact it's mostly air.  Incidentally, it's my wife's favorite."
416872,4,Earl Grey Tea,"This tea was fine...just not my favorite.  I prefer flavored herbal teas, but tried this for regular tea.  It has an unusual flavor, but I do like it for something different."
62699,5,tea has nice mild flavor,"this tea has a nice mild flavor as a hot tea.  I have not yet tried it as an iced tea.  I have not tried any other brand of this kind of tea, but am satisfied enough with this one."
257733,5,Great Spelt Berries,"These are delicious and extremely quick cooking.  Maybe that's because I prefer my grains a little firm/chewy.  Anyway, great product and I'm looking forward to buying more!<br />Thank you!"
535339,5,Vegan Natural Choice,"Vegan. Natural. Traditional plain rye crispbread. Distinctive, but subtle, rye flavor note of the whole grain. Quite neutral and balanced crispbread flavor. Crunchy whole grain goodness. Light airy texture. Provides a good base for any jam, marmalade, or veggie & dressing toppings. Great with soups or bean side dishes. Softer than many harder and even crunchier crispbreads. 40 calories and 2g fiber per slice. Approx. 26 slices per box. Also really like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDDFV8"">Ryvita Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Sesame Rye, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>. Product of Great Britain.

16756,4,very good,"The taste of this was like a pop but it was very refreshing to the mouth.  I liked it because it was healthier than a pop , had great taste and it was very refreshing."
231479,5,Great syrup,This is one of the best values in organic maple syrup.  I purchased a case after trying a few jugs.  We love the stronger flavor of the Grade B.
184305,5,Delicious!,Love the Hazelnut flavored instant coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker but when I do drink/need coffee I go to this. I do wish it came in the canisters though as these packets are sometimes difficult to open especially when I'm still half-asleep in the morning.
219099,5,The cost is worth it for me!,"I'm on ""house arrest"" since I'm pregnant with twins and can't go to Costco anytime I want. So I wanted to get some snacks for my kids. I found what I needed here on Amazon and was very pleased. My kids LOVE these juice boxes and the four flavors are a nice variety. The boxes arrived in two days with Prime safe and sound. I know it costs more than a store, but when you're in a situation like I am, where you can't really get out whenever you want to, then this is a great alternative. Thank you, Amazon!"
394034,4,Not sure it helps much,"I mainly bought this because my son has fairly bad ADHD and I wanted to try more natural routes before things like medication. I am not sure it helps him that much at all, but I know it does help me calm down enough to get sleep when I remember to take it. Which is good, because my insomnia was driving me absolutely nuts!<br />I have to get more 100% cranberry juice, because I prefer this mixed in with juice than I do with water."
158438,5,My favorite Jelly Belly flavor,"I have been a huge fan of Jelly Bellys since I was a kid, which was about 25 years ago.  I have always had a favorite.  At first it was peach, then banana.  Juicy pear came along and that was my favorite for about ten years.  I thought nothing would top it, ever.  Then I tried red apple.  It is sweet and tart and really delicious, my new favorite flavor.  A ten pound box is surprisingly tempting and I am sorry they are currently all sold out."
75450,5,Excellent,This raw cocoa is wonderful. I put it in a whey smoothie with almond milk. I use coconut sugar and some coconut powder. Delicious.
121457,4,Crystal Light Pineapple Orange in packets,"Tastes good, but must use more than indicated to get the same full taste as the tubs in the canisters that they don't make or sell any more."
457676,5,"delicious nuts, great price","I was very pleasantly surprised by these nut.  I've been getting a lot of basil lately from my CSA and needed an inexpensive supply of pine nuts to make all that pesto.  I couldn't face buying them by the 4 oz jar at the supermarket.  I figured that as cheap as these nuts were they may be low grade but good enough for pesto.  I tried them and they were delicious all by themselves, very strong flavor and not the least bit stale."
157367,5,Life saver,"I was suffering from arrhythmia (irregular heart beat) and high blood pressure.  After extensive research and refusal to take any ""medicine"" (useless drugs) I started taking these minerals.  Both problems completely disappeared within a month!  These minerals also help me to get to sleep faster and stay asleep all night.<br /><br />I love this stuff and am a very satisfied customer."
336341,5,Natural goodness!,"I love that these are not only a very tasty treat for my dog, but also good for him, which I am all about!"
513927,5,great food,"We were researching for a good, reasonably priced food to feed our dogs.<br />Our senior dog developed diabetes last year and very quickly went blind.<br />We needed to switch them off Nutro, which they had been on for many years.<br />We were looking for something both our dogs would eat, with good ingredients. (Doberman and Doberman mix)<br />Our diabetic dog loves it and her levels stay within range while on this food.<br />It's great having this delivered directly to our door!"
558413,5,The best of the Tasty Bite meals!,"This is the best of the Tasty Bite Indian retort-packaged dishes.  It is moderately spicy and has a wonderful flavor of eggplant.  It is a bit oily, like some Indian foods can be at times.  The texture is sort of creamy/lumpy because of the eggplant seeds.<br /><br />It is wonderful with a little microwaved frozen broccoli added to bulk up the meal, along with brown rice and some frozen naan.  Yum!<br /><br />This same item is sold camouflaged at Trader Joe's."
282084,5,"Delicious, sophisticated, sublime","I love this stuff. I love limes- I find it the flavor a bit more complex than orange or lemon- and they make a wonderful marmalade. This marmalade isn't bitter like orange marmalade is, and isn't as tart/sweet as a lemon curd would be. A great subtle flavor, and much more grown-up flavor than a berry jam. A wonderful indulgence on a Sunday morning, it practically begs for crumpets and champagne."
378665,2,"Not so sweet or tasty, in my opinion","Everyone has their own taste.  I'm a huge fan of the Good Earth caffeine-free original tea, but my local stores stopped carrying it, so I tried this one from a big box store as a substitute.  The price was right, but it doesn't taste sweet or spicy, compared to the Good Earth."
563034,5,just like grandmas,"I just love the oatmeal raisein cookie it was super soft and delicious, i was amazed by the amount of raisens in it because there usually isnt enough in other brands. Not only did i love this cookie but my daughter loved it so much i had to go out and buy a box of them. Id def. reccomend these to any cookie lover, im a fan for life."
187714,5,"""Sturdy"" comes to mind as the best description!","If asked to sum up this coffee-pod drawer in one word, ""sturdy"" would be my enthusiastic answer. It is one hefty piece of metal sliding-drawer perfection - it weighed in at 4 lbs. 11 oz. on my postal scale!<br /><br />The drawers slide in and out with barely a hitch. Large rubber feet on the bottom means it stays put on your counter. The drawers have stops on the bottom so you won't accidentally pull  them out completely. And best of all, 36 K-cups fit in perfectly, nestling cozily in 3 individual rows per drawer thanks to 2 divider bars in each.<br /><br />Seriously, you can't go wrong with this product if you have only a couple of boxes of K-cups you need to store. So much more attractive than boxes! I do plan to eventually paint mine with metal spray-paint to complement my kitchen's color scheme."
561149,5,winner winner chicken dinner!,"My dog LOVES these.  She loves to chew on things and this is the first toy that she has not destroyed within the first week.  We have had the ball that these treats insert into for over 2 months and it still is like new.  The chicken flavor appears to be her favorite so far.  They will last several days if we don't take the toy away, longer if we limit her exposure or rotate toys. She will lick and lick and chew and chew for hours.  Inserting the treats is a bit difficult but not too bad. We have not had any problems with her removing the treat as others have described, my guess is that they are not getting the treat set into the ball correctly.  This chew toy is a keeper!"
347122,4,Good Basic Tea,"****<br />This is a good, albeit unexciting breakfast tea from Stash. It is made from blended black teas. I much prefer Stash's Organic Breakfast Tea and Stash's Irish Breakfast Tea because both of those have distinctive and pleasurable tastes. However, there is nothing wrong with Stash English Breakfast Tea and it is a good change from basic orange pekoe tea. It can be brewed nice and strong without getting bitter (by brewing it longer), a sign of a good quality tea. Recommended, especially if you enjoy a simple, basic tea.<br />****"
334447,4,great herbal tea selection,"Nice herbal tea selection.  No caffeine, thats just what I was looking for.  Another great peppermint tea.  Chamomile tea is nice too.  Again, got way too much lemon tea that just got passed on to friends and my mother."
255567,3,Interesting rejection,"It is interesting how I had written a review and it was rejected. I looked over the guidelines and there is nothing that was even close to a problem, so here is the benign rewrite of it:<br /><br />Pricing is just not that great considering I can buy it at full price at a number of local retailers for about 67-cents a bottle. If it was the same price or less, then I would consider buying it online. So until that happens, I will have to pass as this is not as good of a deal as it should be."
211564,5,Love it...,Best oilve oil ever.  Period Amen..<br />Way too expensive here.  You can get same size bottle for $19.99.
108498,5,Son's favorite fruit,"I know why--these things taste GREAT!<br /><br />I love the screw top pouches--all I do is grab a spoon, and squeeze a mouthful size amount into the spoon and feed it to my son.  I don't need a bowl to keep the product clean from baby spit.<br /><br />If anything, when he's done eating (if he doesn't eat the whole thing) all we're left with is one spoonful of food that is wasted."
440893,3,"convenient, low-acid, but a bit weak","The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again."
156080,5,O M G this is HOTTTTTTT but I LOVE it!,"I use habanero pepper in a lot of my dishes but boyyy, this cayenne pepper is HOT! I am known for loving hot and spicy stuff! I used it for the first time last night and I think I underestimated the ""90,000 HU."" I poured in close to 1/4 of a cup (did not measure the amount) to what I was cooking and I can barely eat it without having to drink water and chew on crackers. It was as hot as ""blazing"" wings from Buffalo wild wings. And this might be TMI but whenever I ate this dish I cooked and I did a #1, I felt the tingling sensation as if the pepper in my mouth. So my conclusion is I think a little goes a long way."
552324,5,THE BEST,"This is absolutely THE BEST hot chocolate I've ever had!  It is so rich and chocolate-y.  We love it.  It is also delicious in a cup of coffee to make mocha.  You're going to love this and after you've had it, you'll never want any other kind of hot chocolate mix.  Enjoy....."
506367,1,Avoid these treats!!,"We got these at Costco, but same brand and size.  Our dog didn't get sick immediately, but a friend at the dog park mentioned some issues with this brand so we looked around and saw mixed reviews, but most of the really bad reviews were old (2007 or so), so we didn't stop giving them to her altogether, although we didn't give her many either, although she seems to love them.<br /><br />A few days/weeks went by, and then last week we noticed that she was peeing 3-4 times in the morning and in the evening, when she normally would go 1 or 2 times depending on how much running around she did.  At that point we decided to stop giving her any of these treats, and within a few days she was back to normal.  Since other people complaining about these treats mentioned renal failure, and urinating often is a sign of this condition, I'm assuming there's a direct connection as it was immediately after giving here these treats that she started having any issues/conditions with urination."
